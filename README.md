# HackerRank SQL Challenges

This repository contains solutions to [SQL problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) found on HackerRank. Each solution is solved using a MySQL environment.

## Basic Select Challenges

The following challenges all revolve around simple SELECT statements that make use of SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY. The WHERE clauses will use and three basic boolean operators as well as some of the most used functions.

## Aggregation

The following challenges use simple aggregation functions such as MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, and AVG. The final challenge involves calculating a median value - a function which does not exist in most SQL flavours.

## Basic Join

The following challenges require the use INNER JOINs and LEFT JOINs. While the different amount of expressions in each query is low, some require multiple subqueries to solve and therefore there is a varied difficulty of problem solving across these challenges.
